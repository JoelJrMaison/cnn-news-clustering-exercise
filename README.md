This here is a cnn news clustering exercise

before anything make sure you have python installed

then in the command line type
pip install streamlit scikit-learn nltk requests beautifulsoup4  

then you can run 'python scrapper.py' to make sure the file has no errors.

finally run 'streamlit run news_deployed.py' to deploy on streamlit locally

N/B: A drawback is that the clusters do not specify the type or genre of the news articles
